# Factania
Factania is a DS Factory Builder set in the SHUTTLEFALL universe.  
After a crash landing, it's up to you to scrounge for resources and launch back to the Titania Mothership.

# Build Instructions
For a quick build, run build.bat or build.sh in the scripts directory

## Development environment
At the moment, it is easiest to use vscode for development.

### First time setup:
- Launch create-environment.bat/sh **ONCE**.

### Accessing environment
- Open visual studio code, and install the Container Tools extension
  - There should be now a "container" icon in your sidebar, navigate to that
- In the containers menu under `Individual Containers` there should be a container labeled `persist-ds`
  - If it is stopped, right click and select start
- Right click the container and select `Attach Visual Studio Code`
