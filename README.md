# Factania
Factania is a DS Factory Builder set in the SHUTTLEFALL universe.  
After a crash landing, it's up to you to scrounge for resources and launch back to the Titania Mothership.

# Build Instructions
For a quick build, run build.bat or build.sh in the scripts directory

## Development environment

### First time setup:
- Run `git submodule init`
- Run `scripts/generate_visual_studio.bat` if you want to use visual studio
  - This will generate the project in the `visual_studio` directory
